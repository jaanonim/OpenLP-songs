<span id="dualmonitors"></span><h1>Dual Monitor Setup</h1>
<p>The first step in getting OpenLP working on your system is to setup your
computer properly for dual monitors. This is not very difficult, but the steps
will vary depending on operating system.</p>
<p>Most modern computers have the ability for dual monitors. To be certain,
check your computer&#8217;s documentation. A typical desktop computer capable of dual
monitors will have two of, or a combination of the two, connectors below.</p>
<p><strong>VGA</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/vga.png" src="_images/vga.png" />
<p><strong>DVI</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/dvi.png" src="_images/dvi.png" />
<p><strong>HDMI</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/hdmi.png" src="_images/hdmi.png" />
<p><strong>S-Video</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/svideo.png" src="_images/svideo.png" />
<p>A laptop computer setup varies slightly. Generally you will need only one of
the outputs pictured above since your laptop screen serves as one of the
monitors. Some older laptops may require a key stroke generally involving the
<code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Fn</span></code> key and another key (labeled on the keybaord) to enable the second
monitor.</p>
<p>A typical OpenLP setup consist of your normal single monitor, with your
projector hooked up to your computer as the second monitor. With the option of
extending your desktop across the second monitor, or your operating system&#8217;s
equivalent.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note For Projectors Using USB Connections</strong></p>
<p>Users have reported experiencing difficulties when using a projector with a USB
connection. Third party software is often required to properly configure
dual monitors. If possible, it is best to use a direct output (VGA, DVI, HDMI,
S-Video) from your machine&#8217;s video card. If a USB connection is your only option
please consult the manufacturer&#8217;s manual for instructions on a proper setup.</p>
<div class="section" id="microsoft-windows">
<h2>Microsoft Windows</h2>
<p>Dual monitor setup is similar among all the currently supported Windows
releases (<a class="reference internal" href="#win10monitor"><span>Windows 8 &amp; 10</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#win7monitor"><span>Windows 7</span></a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="#winvistamonitor"><span>Windows Vista</span></a>), but does vary slightly from one release to the next.</p>
<div class="section" id="windows-8-10">
<span id="win10monitor"></span><h3>Windows 8 &amp; 10</h3>
<p>When using Windows 8 and 10 enabling your projector is easy. Simply connect your
projector and press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Windows+P</span></code>.</p>
<p>The more traditional way is also fairly straight forward. Go to
<span class="guilabel">Control Panel</span> and click on <span class="guilabel">Adjust screen resolution</span>
under <span class="guilabel">Appearance and Personalization</span>.</p>
<img alt="_images/controlpanel-win10.png" src="_images/controlpanel-win10.png" />
<p>This will open up a window for configuring your screens. Enable your projector
and make sure that the selected value for <span class="guilabel">Multiple displays</span> is
<span class="guilabel">Extend these displays</span>.</p>
<img alt="_images/screen-res-win10.png" src="_images/screen-res-win10.png" />
<p>On Windows 10 there is also a different way of configuring your screens. By
right-clicking on the desktop and choosing <span class="guilabel">Display settings</span> a
different configuration window will appear.</p>
<img alt="_images/new-display-settings-win10.png" src="_images/new-display-settings-win10.png" />
<p>To change the resolution of the screens you will have to click
<span class="guilabel">Advanced display settings</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Windows 8 and 10 have several features that might seem smart on a normal desktop
but which is not something that should be enabled when you want to use the
computer for presenting songs, etc. during a service.</p>
<img alt="_images/task-bar-properties-win8.png" src="_images/task-bar-properties-win8.png" />
<p>Right click the task bar and choose <span class="guilabel">Properties</span>. You should uncheck
<span class="guilabel">Use Peek to preview...</span> since it will totally blank the 2nd display
if hovering mouse over an icon on the taskbar. You should also uncheck
<span class="guilabel">Show taskbar on all displays</span>.</p>
<img alt="_images/task-bar-right-click-win10.png" src="_images/task-bar-right-click-win10.png" />
<p>If you use Windows 10 you should probably also hide the <span class="guilabel">Task View</span>
button from the taskbar, since clicking it will blank your 2nd display. To
disable it, right click the taskbar, and uncheck <span class="guilabel">Show Task View
button</span>.</p>

<div class="section" id="windows-7">
<span id="win7monitor"></span><h3>Windows 7</h3>
<p>Windows 7 has using  a projector in mind. Simply connect your projector and
press <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Windows+P</span></code>.</p>
<p>The more traditional way is also fairly straight forward. Go to
<span class="guilabel">Control Panel</span> and click on <span class="guilabel">Display</span>. This will open up
the <span class="guilabel">Display</span> dialog. You may also bypass this step by a right click
on a blank area on your desktop and selecting <span class="guilabel">Resolution</span>.</p>
<img alt="_images/winsevendisplay.png" src="_images/winsevendisplay.png" />
<p>Then click on the <span class="guilabel">Adjust resolution</span> link in the left pane. Enable
your projector and make sure that the selected value for <span class="guilabel">Multiple

<h2>Linux</h2>
<p>Due to the vast varieties of hardware, distributions, desktops, and drivers
this is not an exhaustive guide to dual monitor setup on Linux. This guide
assumes you have properly set up any proprietary drivers if needed. You
should seek out your distributions documentation if this general guide does not
work.</p>
<p><strong>Note to Ubuntu Users:</strong> Standard Ubuntu uses the Unity interface.
Unfortunately we cannot recommend using Unity for a dual display setup with
OpenLP, since there seems to be no reliable way to hide the menubar from the
secondary display, as well as other issues. Instead we recommend using a
different desktop environment like GNOME, KDE or Xfce, all of which are
available from the Ubuntu repositories, and via special Ubuntu variants, such as
<a class="reference external" href="https://ubuntugnome.org/">Ubuntu GNOME</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="gnome-3">
<h3>GNOME 3</h3>
<p>This guide is for users of the GNOME 3 or GNOME Shell desktop who do not use
proprietary drivers. In GNOME shell in the search box type <em>Displays</em> or in
GNOME shell or fall back mode go to <span class="menuselection">Applications &#8227; System Tools &#8227; System Settings</span>
then select Displays.</p>
<img alt="_images/gnome3displays.png" src="_images/gnome3displays.png" />
<p>By clicking on each of the displays listed you can change the mode, resolution
and orientation of the displays.</p>
<img alt="_images/gnome3displaysettings.png" src="_images/gnome3displaysettings.png" />
<p>Make sure to put the display you plan to use for presenting to be the
<span class="guilabel">Secondary Display</span>.</p>
<img alt="_images/gnome3drag.png" src="_images/gnome3drag.png" />
<p>Back in the <span class="guilabel">Displays</span> window, click <span class="guilabel">Arrange Combined
Displays</span> to arrange the displays.
If after setting up your monitors you have the top panel on the wrong monitor
simply drag it to the monitor you want to serve as the primary screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kde">
<h3>KDE</h3>
<p>This guide is for users of the KDE desktop who do not use proprietary drivers.
From most distros click the Kick Off menu and navigate to
<span class="guilabel">System Settings</span></p>
<img alt="_images/kde5systemsettings.png" src="_images/kde5systemsettings.png" />
<p>Click on the <span class="guilabel">Display and Monitor</span> icon.</p>
<img alt="_images/kde5display.png" src="_images/kde5display.png" />
<p>From here you will need to set up your projector with the appropriate
resolution, and position. OpenLP works best projecting to the monitor on the
right.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="xfce4">
<span id="xfce4display"></span><h3>Xfce4</h3>
<p>This guide is for users of the Xfce4 desktop. Open the Xfce4 menu and chose
<span class="guilabel">Settings Manager</span>.</p>
<img alt="_images/xfce4-settings.png" src="_images/xfce4-settings.png" />
<p>Open <span class="guilabel">Display</span> to open the settings for displays.</p>
<img alt="_images/xfce4-display.png" src="_images/xfce4-display.png" />
<p>If the second display has not yet been enabled, enable it by selecting it in the
window and tick <cite>Use this display</cite>.</p>
<p>There is an issue with the Xfce4 compositor that makes OpenLP freeze when using
a dual monitor setup. This issue can be worked around by disabling an option for
the compositor. To do this open <span class="guilabel">Settings Manager</span> and open
<span class="guilabel">Window Manager Tweaks</span>.</p>
<img alt="_images/xfce4-win-manager-tweaks-comp.png" src="_images/xfce4-win-manager-tweaks-comp.png" />
<p>Go to the <span class="guilabel">Compositor</span> tab and disable <span class="guilabel">Display fullscreen
overlay windows directly</span>. Click <span class="guilabel">Close</span> and now OpenLP should run
without issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linux-systems-using-nvidia-drivers">
<h3>Linux Systems Using nVidia Drivers</h3>
<p>This guide is for users of the proprietary nVidia driver on Linux Distributions.
It is assumed that you have properly setup your drivers according to your
distribution&#8217;s documentation, and you have a working <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xorg.conf</span></code> file in
place.</p>
<p>If you wish to make the changes permanent in setting up your system for dual
monitors it will be necessary to modify your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xorg.conf</span></code> file. It is always a
good idea to make a backup of any critical file before making changes:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>user@linux:~ $ sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.old
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For those using systems that use the root user instead of sudo, change to root
and enter:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>root@linux: # cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.old
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The exact location of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xorg.conf</span></code> file can vary so check your
distribution&#8217;s documentation.</p>
<p>If you want to make your changes permanent run nVidia settings from the
terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>user@linux:~ $ sudo nvidia-settings
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or, as root:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>root@linux: # nvidia-settings
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you do not want to write the changes to your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xorg.conf</span></code> file simply run
the nVidia Settings program (<strong class="command">nvidia-settings</strong>) from your desktop&#8217;s
menu, usually in an administration or system menu, or from the terminal as a
normal user run:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>user@linux:~ $ nvidia-settings
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once you have opened nVidia Settings, click on <span class="guilabel">X Server Display
Configuration</span>. Select the monitor you are wanting to use as your second
monitor and click <span class="guilabel">Configure</span>.</p>
<img alt="_images/nvlinux1.png" src="_images/nvlinux1.png" />
<p>After clicking <span class="guilabel">Configure</span>, select <span class="guilabel">TwinView</span> and click
<span class="guilabel">OK</span>.</p>
<img alt="_images/twinview.png" src="_images/twinview.png" />
<p>Click <span class="guilabel">Apply</span> and if you are happy with the way things look click
<span class="guilabel">Keep</span> to save your new settings. Don&#8217;t worry if something goes wrong,
the settings will return back to the previous settings in 15 seconds without any
action. nVidia Settings should take care of selecting your optimum resolution
etc, but that can be changed as needed. When you are happy with everything click
on <span class="guilabel">Save to X Configuration File</span>.</p>
<img alt="_images/xorgwrite.png" src="_images/xorgwrite.png" />
<p>Click <span class="guilabel">Save</span> and you should be set. You may want to restart X or
your machine just to make sure all the settings carry over the next time you log
in.</p>

<div class="section" id="linux-systems-with-intel-video">
<h3>Linux Systems With Intel Video</h3>
<p>Generally systems with Intel video cards work very well. They are well supported
by open source drivers. There are, however, a couple of issues that may require
some work arounds.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution Issue</strong></p>
<p>There is a limitation with certain cards which limits the total resolution to
2048x2048, so both monitors can not have a total resolution totaling more than
that. To work around this it may be necessary to position your monitor as a top
or bottom monitor as opposed to the typical side by side setup. This can easily
be accomplished through your desktop&#8217;s control of monitors. Please see the
sections on dual monitors with KDE and GNOME above.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Monitor Issues</strong></p>
<p>With certain cards your system may get confused on which is the primary display.
For example many users will be using a laptop. You will want your laptop screen
to be the primary screen, and your projector to be the secondary monitor.
Certain Intel cards reverse this. To work around this you will need to know the
name of your monitor. If you are a KDE user this info is given to you in the
display settings. If you are not using KDE enter the following in a terminal
without your projector connected to your computer:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>user@linux:~ $ xrandr -q
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will give you a long string of output. Screen names will be something along
the lines of LVDM, VGA-0 or some convention similar to that. Without your
projector connected to your computer only one monitor will show as being
connected. That will be the monitor you will need to use as the primary. Now
connect your projector and enter:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>user@linux:~ $ xrandr --output LVDM --primary
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Note</strong> it has been reported that when this issue is occurring you will not
want to connect your projector until your desktop is running.</p>
