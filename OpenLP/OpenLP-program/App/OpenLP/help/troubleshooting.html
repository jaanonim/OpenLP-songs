<h2>Something has gone wrong, what should I do to help get it fixed?</h2>
<p>If you have found an error in the program (what we call a bug) you should report
this to us so that OpenLP can be improved. Before reporting any bugs please
first make sure that there is not already a bug report about your problem:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Check the <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/openlp">Launchpad bug list</a></li>

<li>Check the <a class="reference external" href="http://forums.openlp.org/">http://forums.openlp.org/</a> forum</li>
</ol>
<p>If there <strong>is already a bug report</strong>, you may be able to help by providing
further information. However, <strong>if no one else has reported</strong> it yet, then
please post a new bug report.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The <strong>preferred place</strong> for reporting bugs is the
<a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/openlp">bugs list</a> on Launchpad.</li>
<li>Alternatively, if you do not have a Launchpad account and do not want to sign

<div class="section" id="what-information-should-i-include-in-a-bug-report">
<h2>What information should I include in a bug report?</h2>
<p>Since OpenLP 1.9.4, there is a bug report dialog which automatically opens when
OpenLP hits a serious bug. However, this does not appear all the time, and in
some behavioural bugs, you will have to file a bug report yourself. The following
items are information the developers need in order to reproduce the bug.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Operating System</dt>
<dd>Include information such as the version of your operating system, the
distribution (e.g. Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) if you are using Linux, or the
edition (e.g. Home, Basic, Business, etc.) if you are using Windows.</dd>
<dt>Version of OpenLP</dt>
<dd>You can find out the version of OpenLP by going to <span class="menuselection">Help &#8227; About</span></dd>
<dt>Steps to Reproduce</dt>
<dd>The exact steps the developers need to follow in order to reproduce the bug.</dd>
<dt>Version of MS Office or LibreOffice</dt>
<dd>If you are using the song imports or the presentation plugin, you will need to
supply the version of Office or LibreOffice.</dd>
<dt>Bible Translation and Source</dt>
<dd>If the bug occurred while you were working with Bibles, specify the
translation of the Bible, and the source format if you imported it yourself.</dd>
<dt><strong>Any</strong> Other Information</dt>
<dd>Often bugs are caused by something that might not seem to be directly
related to the bug itself. If you have any other information with regards to
actions you performed or other activities when the bug occurred, it would be
welcomed by the developers.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The more information you give us, the better we can help you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-have-been-asked-to-email-a-debug-log-where-do-i-find-this">
<h2>I have been asked to email a debug log, where do I find this?</h2>
<p>We may need a debug log to help pin-point the issue. A new log file is created
each time you start OpenLP so copy the file before you run the software a second
time. On Windows a Debug option is available in the start menu. On other systems,
you will need to run OpenLP from the command line, with the following
option: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`-l</span> <span class="pre">debug`</span></code>. Please note, that is a lowercase <strong>L</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have not been given a specific email address to send it to, then please do
not paste the log contents straight into a forum post. Instead, open the log
file in a text editor (such as notepad on Windows) and copy and paste the
contents into somewhere like <a class="reference external" href="http://pastebin.com">pastebin.com</a>. Then give us
the link to the page that is created.</p>
<div class="section" id="windows">
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Find the OpenLP 2.4 folder in your Start menu. Choose the &#8220;OpenLP (Debug)&#8221; option.</p>
<p>OpenLP will start up. Go to the <span class="menuselection">Tools &#8227; Open Data Folder</span> menu
option, and an Explorer window will appear containing folders such as alerts,
bibles, custom etc. Keep this Explorer window open.</p>
<p>Now repeat the steps you need to take in OpenLP to reproduce the problem you had,
and then close down OpenLP.</p>
<p>In the Explorer window you left open, navigate up one level into the openlp
folder. You will see the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">openlp.log</span></code> file. This is the file to e-mail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linux-freebsd">
<h3>Linux/FreeBSD</h3>
<p>If you installed OpenLP from a package:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>@:~$ openlp -l debug
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Alternately, if you are running OpenLP from source:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>@:~$ ./openlp.pyw -l debug
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If your Linux distribution supports the XDG standard, you will find the log in:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>~/.cache/openlp/openlp.log
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Otherwise, you will find the log file in:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>~/.openlp/openlp.log
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mac-os-x">
<h3>Mac OS X</h3>
<p>Open Terminal.app and navigate to where you installed OpenLP, usually
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/Applications</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>@:~$ cd /Applications
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then go into the OpenLP.app directory, down to the OpenLP executable:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>@:~$ cd OpenLP.app/Contents/MacOS
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And then run OpenLP in debug mode:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>@:~$ ./openlp -l debug
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once you have done that, you need to get the log file. In your home directory,
open the Library directory, and the Application Support directory within that.
Then open the openlp directory, and you should find the openlp.log file in that
directory:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Application Support/openlp/openlp.log
</pre></div>
</div>

<div class="section" id="i-can-not-play-videos-or-other-media">
<span id="t-no-media"></span><h2>I can not play videos or other media</h2>
<p>If you can not play video or audio through OpenLP, the problem is most likely
that the media players have not be properly configured. The recommended media
player for OpenLP is VLC, see the manual for <a class="reference internal" href="configure.html#config-players"><span>Players</span></a> for how to
setup VLC as your default player.</p>
<p>If you want to use the System player, but it cannot play your media files, you
can look below for how best to set it up.</p>
<div class="section" id="codecs">
<h3>Codecs</h3>
<p>You may need to install codecs for certain files to play. Most newer versions
of Windows and OS X will support most media types. Most Linux distributions
will require a little more help to get certain media types to play.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="microsoft-windows">
<h3>Microsoft Windows</h3>
<p>Later versions of Microsoft Windows (Vista, Windows 7) generally come with
everything you need to play most media formats. If for some reason you need
additional codecs we have seen success from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cccp-project.net/">Combined Community Codec Pack
(CCCP)</a>.  You might also wish to check out the
K-Lite Codec Pack. If you are having issues, results do seem to vary with the
different options. What works for some may not for others, so some trial and
error may be required.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mac">
<h3>Mac</h3>
<p>If you are using a Mac. You may wish to play Windows formats. flip4mac enables
you to use popular Windows formats such as .wmv on your Mac. You can get it
<a class="reference external" href="http://dynamic.telestream.net/downloads/download-flip4macwmv.htm">from here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ubuntu-linux-and-variants">
<h3>Ubuntu Linux (and variants)</h3>
<p>If you are using Ubuntu Linux, or one of its variants (Kubuntu, Edubuntu, etc...)
it is a fairly quick and easy process to get all the codecs you need to make
things work. You will need to install two meta-packages that contain all the
multimedia codecs that you will generally need. From the Software Center install
ubuntu-restricted-extras and Kubuntu-restricted-extras, or from the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>user@linux:~ $ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras kubuntu-restricted-extras
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Note</strong> if you are running Kubuntu there is no need to install the
ubuntu-restricted-extras meta-package</p>
<p>For more information on Ubuntu and multimedia issues please check out the
<a class="reference external" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/">community documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="arch-linux">
<h3>Arch Linux</h3>
<p>The following command provides the most complete solution for codecs on Arch
Linux:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>root@linux:~ # pacman -S gstreamer0.10-{base,good,bad,ugly}-plugins gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg
</pre></div>
</div>

documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debian-linux">
<h3>Debian Linux</h3>
<p>You will need to add the Debian Multimedia Repository. So add the folowing to
/etc/apt/sources.list:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org testing main non-free
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then update the repository info:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>root@linux:~ # apt-get update
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then install the following packages:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>root@linux:~ # apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-lame gstreamer0.10-plugins-really-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-x264
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fedora-linux">
<h3>Fedora Linux</h3>
<p>You will need to set up Fedora to play most media formats. This is accomplished
using the rpmfusion repository.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> the following commands will enable a third party repository to your
system. Please check out <a class="reference external" href="http://rpmfusion.org">the RPM Fusion site</a> for more information.</p>
<p>To enable both the free and nonfree components for any Fedora official release
enter the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>su -c &#39;yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After enabling the rpmfusion repository you will want to refresh your package
list, perform any updates and search for gstreamer-good, bad, and ugly and
install.</p>
<p>Follow the tutorial <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/video/getting-mp3-support-fedora-using-rpmfusion-repositories">using the rpmfusion repository</a>

<p>Currently OpenLP does not support PowerPoint Viewer 2010. PowerPoint 2010 should
work correctly, although some users have reported problems. If you have issues
with PowerPoint 2010 or PowerPoint Viewer 2010 try the PowerPoint 2003 or 2007

<h2>I chose to use a web Bible but it did not download the entire Bible</h2>
<p>Due to copyright restrictions OpenLP cannot download an entire Bible. It can
only download the section you search for. If you do not have an internet
connection where you intend to use OpenLP you will need another scripture
source. For more information about acquiring Bibles please see the section on
the <a class="reference internal" href="bibles.html#import-bibles"><span>Bible Import Wizard</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="openlp-is-using-a-large-amount-of-ram-when-showing-a-presentation">
<h2>OpenLP is using a large amount of RAM when showing a presentation</h2>
<p>OpenLP uses a large amount of RAM when showing a presentation due to the way it
handles presentations. OpenLP itself is unable to show those presentations or
load the presentation files, so it interacts with the presentation through
either Microsoft PowerPoint or LibreOffice Impress. In order to show the slides
in the slide controller, OpenLP requests that the presentation application
export the slides to images, and then uses those images as slides. This results
in a large amount of RAM being used, especially in presentations with more than
about 20 slides.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="openlp-is-not-displaying-correctly-or-is-not-on-the-correct-screen">
<h2>OpenLP is not displaying correctly, or is not on the correct screen</h2>
<p>Please read the documentation on <a class="reference internal" href="dualmonitors.html#dualmonitors"><span>Dual Monitor Setup</span></a>. It is very important to
have dual monitors setup properly for OpenLP to function as expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="previews-are-slow-to-load-when-using-a-theme-with-an-image-background">
<h2>Previews are slow to load when using a theme with an image background</h2>
<p>If you are using a JPG formatted image for your background try converting it
to another format. There is a notable performance difference between JPG and
a format such as PNG. Other formats work in OpenLP but PNG is the preferred
image format and yields the best performance. Images should also be sized to
the size of your output. For example, if your output screen is 1024x768 you
should size your background image to 1024x768 also. OpenLP does not scale
images.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="openlp-crashes-on-startup-on-windows">
<h2>OpenLP crashes on startup on Windows</h2>
<p>If Windows is missing a proper driver for the graphics card on the computer, it

the newest driver for your graphics card.</p>

accessible by going to <span class="menuselection">Settings &#8227; Configure OpenLP &#8227; Media</span>.
As for text over video, we have no solution for speeding this up. Reducing the
monitor resolution and avoiding shadows and outline text will help. We are
hoping a future release of the toolkit we are using (QtWebKit) will help improve
this, but there is no timeframe at present.</p>

<div class="section" id="downgrade-guide-how-to-restore-a-backup">
<h2>Downgrade guide (how to restore a backup)</h2>
<p>In some cases new versions of OpenLP can contain bugs that was not discovered
during testing, which in some cases can mean that OpenLP cannot function
probably and the only way out is to downgrade to the previous version.</p>
<p>Since the OpenLP 2.2 release, new versions of OpenLP always ask if a backup
should be made of the data on the first run. It is always recommend to create
this backup, since OpenLPs data format often changes between versions, which
means that older OpenLP versions cannot read the data created by newer versions.
In case of downgrading this backup can be restored. To perform a downgrade
follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Open OpenLP and in the menu go to <span class="menuselection">Tools &#8227; Open Data</span> Folder
to open the current data folder in a fileexplorer. If OpenLP cannot open due
to a bug see <a class="reference internal" href="faq.html#data-folder"><span>Where do I find the data folder?</span></a>.</li>
<li>Keep the fileexplorer window open and close OpenLP</li>
<li>Uninstall OpenLP and install the old version (if you have not done this
already). Do not run OpenLP when the installation completes.</li>
<li>In the fileexplorer go up one folder-level. You should now see a lot of
folders, find the folders that starts with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">openlp</span></code>. Depending on how many
upgrades you have done you will see some folders looking like
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">openlp-20160128-185424</span></code>. These folders are the backups made by OpenLP on
upgrade. The numbers are a timestamp that you can use to find the backup with
the you wish to restore.</li>
<li>Rename the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">openlp</span></code> folder to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">openlp-broken-update</span></code> or similar.</li>
<li>Rename the backup folder you wish to restore to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">openlp</span></code>.</li>
<li>Start OpenLP and watch it load your restored data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: This does not restore your settings!</p>
