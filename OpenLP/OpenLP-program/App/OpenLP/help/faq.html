</div>
<div class="section" id="what-operating-systems-will-openlp-2-4-support">
<h3>What operating systems will OpenLP 2.4 support?</h3>
<p>OpenLP 2.4 is designed to be cross platform. Currently it has been known to run
on Windows (Vista, 7, 8, 10), Linux (Ubuntu and its variants, Fedora, Debian,
ArchLinux, Mint, OpenSUSE and many many others), FreeBSD &amp; Mac OS X.
<a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openlp.org/Help:Contents">Please let us know</a> if you have
successfully run it on something else.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="which-programming-language-is-2-4-developed-in">
<h3>Which programming language is 2.4 developed in?</h3>
<p>OpenLP 2.4 is written in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python3</a> and uses the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.qt.io">Qt5 toolkit</a>. Both are cross-platform which allows the
software to run on different types of machine and so allow more people access to
free worship software. Python is one of the easier programming languages to
learn, so this helps us develop and <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openlp.org/Bug#Something_has_gone_wrong.2C_what_should_I_do_to_help_get_it_fixed.3F">find bugs</a>
quicker, and also allows more developers to contribute with the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="which-written-languages-does-openlp-support">
<h3>Which written languages does OpenLP support?</h3>
<p>OpenLP has support for multiple languages which can be seen on the
<span class="menuselection">Settings &#8227;Translate</span> menu. However some of these translations
are incomplete. If you would like to help complete or start to translate OpenLP
into your language then see the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openlp.org/Translation:Getting_Started">Getting started page</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="upgrading">
<h2>Upgrading</h2>
<div class="section" id="can-i-upgrade-from-any-1-9-x-or-2-0-x-release-to-2-4">
<h3>Can I upgrade from any 1.9.x or 2.0.x release to 2.4?</h3>
<p>No, you should first upgrade to the last stable release in the 2.0-series
(2.0.5) and then upgrade to 2.4 to ensure that data is correctly converted.
You can download OpenLP 2.0.5 from &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openlp/files/openlp/2.0.5/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/openlp/files/openlp/2.0.5/</a>&gt;`_.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-i-upgrade-directly-from-1-2-to-2-4">
<h3>Can I upgrade directly from 1.2 to 2.4?</h3>
<p>No, you will have to install 2.0.5 first, then import the 1.2 data and then
upgrade to 2.4. See the 2.0 documentation for how to upgrade from 1.2 to
2.0. You can download OpenLP 2.0.5 from &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openlp/files/openlp/2.0.5/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/openlp/files/openlp/2.0.5/</a>&gt;`_.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-2-4-replace-older-2-x-versions-or-can-they-be-run-side-by-side">
<h3>Does 2.4 replace older 2.x versions, or can they be run side by side?</h3>
<p>OpenLP 2.4 and earlier 2.x versions cannot run side by side. When running 2.4 for first time
any existing 2.x data will automatically be converted to the 2.4 format.
Note that OpenLP 2.4 is not backwards compatible with earlier 2.x versions. Once you have
upgraded from the older OpenLP versions cannot read the upgraded files. OpenLP 2.4 will
ask if it should make a backup on startup, which can be used in case you want
to downgrade again.</p>
<p>OpenLP 2.4 cannot read service files created by OpenLP 2.0.4 and earlier, it can only
read service files created by OpenLP 2.0.5.</p>

<h2>Using OpenLP</h2>
<div class="section" id="i-have-started-openlp-but-i-cannot-see-the-songs-or-bibles-section-in-the-media-manager">
<h3>I have started OpenLP, but I cannot see the songs or bibles section in the Media Manager</h3>
<p>When you installed OpenLP, the first time wizard would have asked which plugins
you wanted, and songs and bibles should have been selected. If for some reason
they were not, then you will need to activate them yourself. See below
for instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-i-activate-deactivate-a-plugin">
<h3>How do I activate / deactivate a plugin?</h3>
<p>Plugins can be turned on and off from the Plugin List Screen. Select the plugin
you wish to start/stop and change its status. You should not need to restart
OpenLP.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-these-plugins-that-i-keep-seeing-mentioned">
<h3>What are these plugins that I keep seeing mentioned?</h3>
<p>The plugins allow OpenLP to be extend easily.  A number have been written
(Songs, Bibles, Presentations) etc but it is possible for the application to be
extended with functionality only you require.  If this is the case then go for
it but lets us know as we can help and it may be something someone else wants.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-i-enable-powerpoint-impress-powerpoint-viewer">
<h3>How do I enable PowerPoint/Impress/PowerPoint Viewer?</h3>
<p>First of all ensure that the presentation plugin is enabled (see above).
Then to enable a presentation application, go to the <cite>Settings</cite> dialog, switch
to the <cite>Presentations</cite> tab and check one of the enabled checkboxes. OpenLP will
automatically detect which of the three you have installed, and enable the
appropriate checkbox(es). Check the applications you require, and then restart
OpenLP for the change to be detected.
Note, PowerPoint Viewer 2010 is not yet supported, use 2003 or 2007.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-can-libreoffice-impress-not-be-used-on-mac-os-x">
<h3>Why can LibreOffice Impress not be used on Mac OS X?</h3>
<p>Currently the presentations plugin does not support Impress on OS X. The
reason for that is that the interoperability component (pyuno) in LibreOffice on
Mac OS X cannot be used by OpenLP due to incompatibilities between the version
of Python used by LibreOffice and the Python version used by OpenLP.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-can-ms-powerpoint-not-be-used-on-mac-os-x">
<h3>Why can MS PowerPoint not be used on Mac OS X?</h3>
<p>Currently the presentations plugin does not support PowerPoint on OS X. The
reason for that is that so far we have found that the available method to
control PowerPoint on OS X is not good enough for integration with OpenLP.
If this changes we will look at including this feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-am-on-windows-and-powerpoint-is-installed-but-it-does-not-appear-as-an-option">
<h3>I am on Windows and PowerPoint is installed, but it does not appear as an option</h3>
<p>Try installing the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&amp;displaylang=en">Visual C++ Runtime Redistributable</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-does-powerpoint-presentations-not-advance-automatically">
<h3>Why does PowerPoint presentations not advance automatically</h3>
<p>The reason that PowerPoint does not advance automatically is that it can only do
so when it has the focus. But when using OpenLP for controlling presentation,
OpenLP has the focus. So in order to make PowerPoint advance automatically the
focus must be switched to PowerPoint, which can be done by clicking the
Powerpoint-icon in the taskbar once the PowerPoint presentation has opened.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-it-possible-to-get-bible-x-how">
<h3>Is it possible to get Bible x? How?</h3>
<p>The Bible plugin has a <cite>Import Wizard</cite> which can import Bibles
from a variety of sources. The following sources are supported:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>CSV</dt>
<dd>The format is documented in the <a class="reference external" href="http://api.openlp.io/api/openlp/plugins/bibles/lib/csvbible.html#module-openlp.plugins.bibles.lib.csvbible">OpenLP API documentation</a>.</dd>
<dt>OSIS</dt>
<dd><p class="first">An XML format for Bible. You can export Bibles from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.crosswire.org/sword/software/">Sword Project</a>
into OSIS using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mod2osis</span></code> tool. After using the Sword software Media
Manager (or other Sword frontend, like BibleTime or Xiphos) to download the
required Bible, run the following command from the command line (works on
Windows and Linux):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mod2osis &lt;name&gt; &gt; &lt;name&gt;.osis
</pre></div>
</div>
<p class="last">The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;name&gt;</span></code> parameter is the name of your Bible, as you see it in Sword.
Note that the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;name&gt;</span></code> is case sensitive on all environments. Once you
have exported your Bible to OSIS, the Bible import wizard will the read
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;name&gt;.osis</span></code> file and import your Bible.</p>
</dd>
<dt>OpenSong</dt>
<dd>OpenSong has a good selection of Bibles on their
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensong.org/d/downloads#bible_translations">download page</a>.</dd>
<dt>Web Download</dt>
<dd><p class="first">OpenLP can download Bibles on demand from the following 3 sites:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://biblestudy.crosswalk.com/bibles/">Crosswalk</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/">BibleGateway</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.bibleserver.com">BibleServer</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Zefania</dt>
<dd>The Zefania project has many bibles available from <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zefania-sharp/files/Bibles/">their website</a></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-do-my-bible-verses-take-a-long-time-to-load">
<h3>Why do my Bible verses take a long time to load?</h3>
<p>In order to better conform to copyright law, the Web Download Bibles are not
downloaded when you import them, but on the fly as you search for them. As a
result, the search takes a little longer if you need to download those
particular verses. Having said that, the Web Download Bibles cache downloaded
verses so that you do not need to download them again.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-bible-is-on-the-web-download-sites-but-my-church-is-not-on-the-internet-what-options-do-i-have">
<h3>My Bible is on the Web Download sites, but my Church is not on the internet. What options do I have?</h3>
<p>When you create and save a service, all the items in the service are saved with
it. That means any images, presentations, songs and media items are saved. This
is also true for bibles. What this means is you can create the service on your
home computer, insert a Bible passage from the web, save it and then open the
service using your church computer and voila, the Bible passage should be there!
Note this can also be done with songs, etc!</p>
