<span id="wizard"></span><h1>First Time Wizard</h1>
<p>When using OpenLP for the first time, the <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#g-ftwizard"><span>First Time Wizard</span></a> will help you
with setting up your installation. This wizard is not intended to be a
comprehensive setup but will help you with the basics.</p>
<div class="section" id="select-translation">
<h2>Select Translation</h2>
<img alt="_images/001-first-time-language.png" src="_images/001-first-time-language.png" />
<p>You can choose the translation you want to use or let OpenLP
automatically select it based on your operating system locale. Click
<span class="guilabel">OK</span> to continue.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Welcome to the First Time Wizard&#8221; dialog box will appear next. Click
<span class="guilabel">Next</span>.</p>
<img alt="_images/002-first-time-wizard-welcome.png" src="_images/002-first-time-wizard-welcome.png" />
<p>The wizard will now download information from a server about which bibles, songs
and themes that can be downloaded be the wizard. This can take a few moments,
depending on the speed of your internet connection and the load on the server,
so please be patient.</p>

<div class="section" id="activate-required-plugins">
<h2>Activate Required Plugins</h2>
<img alt="_images/004-first-time-wizard-plugins.png" src="_images/004-first-time-wizard-plugins.png" />
<p>OpenLP has several plugins to choose from. By default, all plugins are enabled,
except the <em>Remote Access</em> plugin. For more information on these plugins, please
read the <a class="reference internal" href="mediamanager.html"><em>Media Manager</em></a> section in the manual. If you are not sure of which
plugins to enable or disable, leave the selection as is. You can easily activate
or deactivate plugins later, when OpenLP is running, by going to
<span class="menuselection">Settings &#8227; Plugin List</span>. Click <span class="guilabel">Next</span> to continue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sample-songs">
<h2>Sample Songs</h2>
<img alt="_images/005-first-time-wizard-songs.png" src="_images/005-first-time-wizard-songs.png" />
<p>OpenLP provides some sample songs in a few languages for downloading and
importing into your new song database. This is convenient for new users who do
not have any songs yet. If you already have songs in your database, OpenLP will
simply add these sample songs to your database, leaving your existing songs
intact. Once you are happy with which songs you&#8217;d like, click <span class="guilabel">Next</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sample-bibles">
<h2>Sample Bibles</h2>
<img alt="_images/006-first-time-wizard-bibles.png" src="_images/006-first-time-wizard-bibles.png" />
<p>There are also a number of free Bibles that you can download and install. Using
the check box next to each Bible, select each Bible that you would like
installed. If you do not wish to install any Bibles, simply leave them all
unchecked. Once you are happy with your selection, click <span class="guilabel">Next</span> to
continue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sample-themes">
<h2>Sample Themes</h2>
<img alt="_images/007-first-time-wizard-themes.png" src="_images/007-first-time-wizard-themes.png" />
<p>Some sample themes are also available for download and installation into OpenLP.
As with the Bibles, simply check the check box next to each theme to select it.
If you are a new user, these themes can help you understand how themes work. If
you are happy with your selected themes, click <span class="guilabel">Next</span> to continue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="default-settings">
<h2>Default Settings</h2>
<img alt="_images/008-first-time-wizard-settings.png" src="_images/008-first-time-wizard-settings.png" />
<div class="section" id="default-display-monitor">
<h3>Default Display Monitor</h3>
<p>Screen 2. If you are installing OpenLP but are not connected to a second output
at the time, you can set this up later by going to
<span class="menuselection">Settings &#8227; Configure OpenLP</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="default-theme">
<h3>Default Theme</h3>
<p>If you have selected one or more themes on the themes page of the wizard, you
can select which theme you&#8217;d like to be the default theme.</p>
<p>If you are happy with the selections you have made, click <span class="guilabel">Next</span> to
continue to the next page.</p>
<img alt="_images/009-first-time-wizard-progress.png" src="_images/009-first-time-wizard-progress.png" />
<p>Making progress.</p>
<img alt="_images/010-first-time-wizard-finished.png" src="_images/010-first-time-wizard-finished.png" />
<p>On the last page of the wizard, OpenLP will download the sample songs, Bibles
and themes, and set up OpenLP for you. Click <span class="guilabel">Finish</span> and OpenLP will
start.</p>
<img alt="_images/splash-screen.png" src="_images/splash-screen.png" />
<p>First the OpenLP logo will be shown for a few seconds while the program loads.</p>
<img alt="_images/011-first-time-wizard-song-import.png" src="_images/011-first-time-wizard-song-import.png" />
<p>Then OpenLP will import the songs that were added by the first time wizard.</p>
